# ArtEmis
ArtEmis (Art Emotions) is a dataset derived from the WikiArt collection of artworks, where each image is paired with human-written captions expressing emotions, interpretations, or descriptions of the artwork. We have trained CNN+LSTM and Transformer models to predict similar descriptive captions after training on a subset of the dataset.
